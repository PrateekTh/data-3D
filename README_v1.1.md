# Temporary Changelog V1.1

Let's begin the next sprint of adding features to the current state of the project!

> This is a temporary devlog, which I'll be converting to an updatelog one once this iteration is done!

First of all, I'm really thankful to the 15-20 or so people who visited and tried this tool out! I hope it added some value to your current project/endeavour, or just provided amusement to the point of curled lips and raised eyebrows.
